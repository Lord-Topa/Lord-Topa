On my profile I plan to have both personal projects and course work that I have done

However currently I am still attending classes and we have been advised that uploading our coursework could result in us getting in trouble for academic dishonesty if someone were to use it without our permission. With that in mind I have chosen to keep said work private, however I would be willing to share it upon request from a potential employer.
