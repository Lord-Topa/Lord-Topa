## Who Am I:
I am a driven individual with a love for all things technology. I find a particular joy from finding ways to navigate obstacles.
I am particularly interested in Cyber Security more specifically penatration testing. Currently I am learning about info gathering and physical security risks 
by experimenting with a new penatration testing tool I got called FlipperZero.

*Note: I am still attending classes and we have been advised that uploading our coursework could result in us getting in trouble for academic dishonesty if someone were to use it without our permission. With that in mind I have chosen to keep said work private, however I would be willing to share it upon request from a potential employer.*
